"""
Filesystem Implementation of a reader.

This is a simple implementation of a reader, created primarily to test the
Reader class. It acts similarly to the blob_reader - it will iterate over
a set of folders, defined by a template and a daterange, read through each
of the files in those folders and present the content back, line by line.
