Reader

Reads records from a data store, opinionated toward Google Cloud Storage
but a filesystem reader was created primarily to assist with development.

The reader will iterate over a set of files and return them to the caller
as a single stream of records. The files can be read from a single folder
or can be matched over a set of date/time formatted folder names. This is
useful to read over a set of logs. The date range is provided as part of 
the call; this is essentially a way to partition the data by date/time.

The reader can filter records to return a subset, for json formatted data
the records can be converted to dictionaries before filtering. json data
can also be used to select columns, so not all read data is returned.

The reader does not support aggregations, calculations or grouping of data,
it is a log reader and returns log entries. The reader can convert a set
into Pandas dataframe, or the dictset helper library can perform some 
activities on the set in a more memory efficient manner.
